# CMSC624: Database System Architecture and Implementation

This course is designed to provide students with an in-depth overview of database architectures --- both the mainstream traditional architecture and also more modern architectures that are especially prevalent in cloud implementations. Students will be trained to reason about different architectural choices for different application spaces, and the tradeoffs inherent in these choices. Students will also get experience with building different parts of database systems. Although the main focus of the course will be database systems, the course will also touch on architectural choices in other types of systems --- including file systems and general distributed systems. The course will be designed to assume that students will already have taken an introductory database course such as CMSC 424. Undergraduates that have taken CMSC 424 should feel comfortable taking 624 afterwards.
